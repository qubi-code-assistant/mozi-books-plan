# Mozi Books - Sales Strategy & Action Plan
**Date:** February 7, 2026  
**Objective:** Sell 199 Hormozi "$100M Money Models" books before August 19, 2026  
**Target Recovery:** $3,500 - $4,500 of $6,000 investment

---

## Executive Summary

You have claim codes for 199 books. Recipients pay only S&H (~$5-10) directly to Acquisition.com. Your monetization options:

1. **Sell access to claim codes** — Charge fee + recipient pays own S&H
2. **Bulk ship to yourself** — Get all 199 shipped to one address, then resell
3. **Hybrid** — Some direct, some bulk

**Recommended:** Option 2 (Bulk to US address) for maximum control and margin.

## Phase 1: Preparation (Week 1-2)

### Immediate Actions

| # | Task | Owner | Deadline | Status |
|---|------|-------|----------|--------|
| 1 | Email ACQ Support for bulk shipping quote to US address | Eduard | Feb 8 | ⬜ |
| 2 | Decide: UK or US shipping destination | Eduard | Feb 10 | ⬜ |
| 3 | Set up tracking spreadsheet | Qubi | Feb 8 | ⬜ |
| 4 | Review and customize email templates | Eduard | Feb 9 | ⬜ |
| 5 | Create simple order form (Google Form) | Qubi | Feb 10 | ⬜ |

### Shipping Decision Matrix

| Scenario | Bulk S&H Cost | Resale Price | Net per Book | Total Net |
|----------|---------------|--------------|--------------|-----------|
| Bulk to UK | ~$1,000-1,500 | $22-25 | ~$17-20 | $3,400-4,000 |
| Bulk to US | ~$400-700 | $20-22 | ~$18-20 | $3,600-4,000 |
| Direct (recipients pay S&H) | $0 | $15-20 fee | $15-20 | $3,000-4,000 |

**Recommendation:** Bulk to US address if you have a reliable contact there. Lower shipping cost = higher margin.
