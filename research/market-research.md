## 5. Shipping Economics

### US Domestic (USPS Media Mail)
- **1 book:** $3-4
- **5 books:** $6-8
- **10 books:** $10-12
- Best option for individual sales

### Bulk to UK (from US)
- **199 books bulk:** Estimate $600-1,200 total
- Need quote from ACQ team
- Consider: bulk to US address first, then resell domestically

### Fulfillment Options
1. **Ship all to UK** - higher cost, full control
2. **Ship to US address** - lower cost, need US fulfillment partner
3. **Drop-ship from ACQ** - each recipient pays their own S&H

## 6. Risk Assessment

### Risks
- **Time decay:** Value may decrease as more copies circulate
- **Competition:** Other bulk buyers may flood market
- **Shipping costs:** International shipping eats margins
- **Deadline:** Unredeemed by Aug 19, 2026 = donated

### Mitigations
- **Act fast:** First-mover advantage on resale market
- **Target bulk buyers:** Coaches want 10-50+ at a time
- **US strategy:** Ship bulk to US, avoid international costs
- **Track progress:** Weekly sales monitoring

---

## 7. Recommendations

### Primary Strategy: Bulk B2B Sales
Target coaches, course creators, and masterminds who buy 10-50 books at once. They're motivated buyers who see books as investments, not expenses.

### Secondary Strategy: Individual Sales
eBay/Facebook Marketplace for remaining inventory at $22-25/book.

### Pricing Strategy
| Quantity | Price per Book | Discount |
|----------|----------------|----------|
| 1-4 | $25 | — |
| 5-9 | $22 | 12% off |
| 10-24 | $20 | 20% off |
| 25-49 | $18 | 28% off |
| 50+ | $16 | 36% off |

### Revenue Projection
- **Best case (bulk @ $20):** 199 × $20 = $3,980
- **Mixed (bulk + individual):** ~$4,200
- **Worst case (fire sale @ $15):** $2,985
