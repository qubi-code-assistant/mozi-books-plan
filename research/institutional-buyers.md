## Email Template for Institutions

**Subject:** Bulk business books for your [members/program/team]

```
Hi [Name],

I'm reaching out regarding a unique opportunity for [Organization Name].

I have 199 copies of Alex Hormozi's new "$100M Money Models" book available at bulk pricing (30-40% below retail). This is Hormozi's latest release on business strategy and monetization — highly practical content for [entrepreneurs/executives/sales professionals].

This could work well for:
- [Program/event name] materials
- Member/attendee gifts
- Leadership development resources
- Reading lists for [specific group]

Given [Organization]'s focus on [their mission], I thought this might be a fit.

Would you be open to a quick conversation?

Best regards,
Eduard Ciugulea
```
