## Email Sequence 1: Business Coaches & Course Creators

### Email 1 (Initial Outreach)

**Subject Lines (A/B test):**
- A: "199 Hormozi books - looking for the right partner"
- B: "Bulk $100M Money Models books - are you interested?"
- C: "[Name] - a quick opportunity for your clients"

**Body:**

```
Hi [Name],

Quick question: Do you give books to your clients, students, or event attendees?

I have 199 copies of Alex Hormozi's new "$100M Money Models" book available at a significant discount. These are legitimate copies from the August 2025 launch.

Why this might matter to you:
- Brand new Hormozi release (his audience loves everything he creates)
- You'd pay roughly $18-22/book vs $30 retail
- Perfect for course bonuses, client gifts, or event giveaways

I'm looking for 3-5 partners who can take 25-50 books each. First come, first served.

Worth a quick call?

Best,
Eduard

### Email 2 (Follow-up, Day 3)

**Subject:** Re: 199 Hormozi books - looking for the right partner

```
Hi [Name],

Following up on my note about the Hormozi books.

Quick context: I purchased the $100M Playbook bundle which came with 199 book claim codes. Rather than let them expire (they get donated August 2026), I'd rather get them into the hands of entrepreneurs who'll use them.

A few coaches have already reached out. Still have about [X] available.

If you're running any programs in the next 6 months where a $30 business book would add value, this is a unique opportunity.

Happy to jump on a 5-minute call if helpful.

Eduard
```

### Email 3 (Break-up, Day 7)

**Subject:** Should I close the loop?

```
Hi [Name],

I'll keep this short.

I have limited Hormozi "$100M Money Models" books at a discount. You seemed like a potential fit given your work with [their audience type].

If the timing's not right, no worries — I'll move on.

But if there's any interest, just reply "interested" and I'll send details.

Either way, appreciate your time.

Quick follow-up on the Hormozi book arbitrage opportunity.

I checked eBay yesterday - sellers are getting $22-25 per copy, with some premium listings at $30+.

I'm motivated to move these before August 2026. Can do a test order of 20-30 books if you want to verify quality before committing to more.

Let me know.

🚨 Unique Opportunity for Coaches/Course Creators

I purchased Alex Hormozi's $100M Playbook bundle, which came with 199 copies of his new "$100M Money Models" book.

Rather than let them expire (they get donated in August), I'm offering them at a discount to entrepreneurs who'll actually use them.

Perfect for:
✅ Course bonuses
✅ Client welcome gifts  
✅ Event giveaways
✅ Mastermind resources

DM me "BOOKS" if you're interested in 5+ copies.

(Mods: Happy to remove if this violates any rules — just trying to get these into good hands!)
```

### Hormozi Fan Communities

```
Fellow Hormozi fans 👋

Got 199 extra "$100M Money Models" book codes from the August launch bundle.

Before they expire and get donated, seeing if anyone here wants them at a discount.

You'd pay me a small handling fee + cover your own shipping.

DM if interested. First come first served.

## Phone Pitch Script (60 seconds)

**Opening:**
> "Hi [Name], this is Eduard. I'll be quick — I have 199 copies of Alex Hormozi's new Money Models book at bulk pricing. I'm looking for coaches or course creators who might use them as bonuses or gifts. Is that something that could be relevant for you?"

**If interested:**
> "Great. I purchased the $100M Playbook bundle which came with these book codes. Rather than let them expire, I'm offering them at roughly $18-22 per book, depending on volume. Most coaches I've spoken with are interested in 25-50 copies. What kind of volume might work for you?"

**Handling objections:**

*"Why are you selling them?"*
> "Honestly, I bought the bundle for the playbooks and AI access. These book codes are a bonus I don't need 199 of. Rather than let them get donated, I'd rather get some value back."

*"How do I know they're legit?"*
> "They're from the official Acquisition.com August 2025 launch. I can show you my order confirmation and the redemption portal. Happy to start with a small test order if you want to verify."
